# Fertilizer Ranking (Kaggle Playground Series - S5E6)

This project builds a ranking-based machine learning model to recommend the top 3 fertilizers for given soil and crop conditions. It was developed as part of a submission to the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 6](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e6) competition, which provides a synthetic dataset for predicting suitable fertilizers.

The model uses **CatBoost**, a gradient boosting library optimized for categorical features, and is fine-tuned using **Optuna**, a hyperparameter optimization framework. Evaluation is based on **Mean Average Precision at 3 (MAP@3)**, which rewards correct predictions appearing earlier in the ranked list.


## Notebooks Overview

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `FertilizerExploration.ipynb` | Preliminary data exploration and feature understanding using the original (non-synthetic) dataset. |
| `FertilizerTuning_Phase1.ipynb` | Broad hyperparameter tuning with Optuna to explore viable ranges. |
| `FertilizerTuning_Phase2.ipynb` | Focused tuning within narrowed ranges from Phase 1. |
| `FertilizerModelValidation.ipynb` | 4-fold cross-validation with early stopping to estimate final model performance and determine iteration count. |

## Key Features

- **CatBoostClassifier**: Leverages native handling of categorical features.
- **Optuna Tuning**: Efficient hyperparameter search with pruning and importance analysis.
- **Custom MAP@3 Evaluation**: Metric implemented in `utils.py` to evaluate and optimize ranking quality.
- **Final Ranking Pipeline**: Generates submission-ready predictions using trained CatBoost model.

## Scripts

- `FertilizerRankings.py`: Loads the full dataset, trains the final model with tuned parameters and calibrated iteration count, and generates ranked predictions for the test set.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for MAP@3 scoring, ranking conversion, and formatted string output.
